HOW TO USE:

FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK:
When starting the program, please Select a picture as Body.
Do the same for another as signature.
This needs to be done otherwise the app crashes.

Type in text as body and farewell.
The design will be Text-Picture-Text-Signature.
The REFRESH BUTTON clears everything

An orientation can also be chosen for the picture.

NOTE:
The program will register the picture as aligned "left" by default.
The alignment needs to be re-selected after a REFRESH.
